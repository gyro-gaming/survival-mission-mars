You have been deployed from Mars HQ to a remote outpost.  Your objective is to return this outpost to operational status.
In order to do so, you must return the Solar farm to operational status for basic lighting, turn on the reactor for full power,
initialize the hydro system to provide both breathable air and water and utilize the provided water for planting seeds in the
greenhouse and obtaining growth from those seeds.  You have 14 days to complete these tasks. After 12 days, if you have not
accomplished all these tasks you will be given the option to continue AT YOUR OWN RISK, or return to Mars HQ as a complete and
total failure, with your head held low.
