This is a text-based, free-adventure style game (meaning you are free to roam about as you see fit.) You will be
prompted for input at the cursor '>> ' and your commands should be simple (for example: 'go north', 'take cup', etc...
The following are the available actions: 'GO', 'GET', 'DROP', 'USE', 'LOOK' -- and of course, there are a variety of synonyms
available for you to discover as well.  At any time, you can also use the available 'HELP' for assistance and 'QUIT' to quit the game.
The second word of your command following your action can be directional (north, south, east, west), the name of the item you see
in the location or in your inventory (key, map, etc), the room itself (room), or your full inventory (inventory). You may also examine
the status of a location's current oxygen levels with the command 'look oxygen'
