Before you, you set your gaze upon what appears to be a very intricate electro-pressurized water tank.  You notice a
label on the tank, "25,000 gallons". Nestled neatly beside the tank, affixed to the side is an electrolysis machine,
something you've heard of before, but never seen.  Fortunately, on the platform access panel, you notice a placard with
some basic instructions for novice Marstranauts such as yourself. The placard reads simply:
1. Check the particle filter.
2. Check NH3 [Ammonia] & C3H6O [Acetone] monitors.
3. Check current room oxygen level.
4. Visually inspect tank for damage, wear or leakage.
5. Verify water level is satisfactory.
6. Push 'Power' button to pressurize water system.
7. After power on, engage electrolysis system to start Oxygen Generation System.
