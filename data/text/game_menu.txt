This is a SWING GUI, free-adventure style game (meaning you are free to roam about as you see fit.) You will be allowed to use radio buttons to navigate, grab, look and use items.
Your commands should be simple (for example: 'go north', 'take cup', etc...
The following are the available actions: 'GO', 'GET', 'DROP', 'USE', 'LOOK' 'INSPECT' --
At any time, you can also use the available 'HELP' for assistance, 'SAVE' to save game, 'Retrieve Game' to return to a past session, and 'QUIT' to quit the game.
The second word of your command following your action can be directional (north, south, east, west), the name of the item you see
in the location or in your inventory (key, map, etc), the room itself (room), or your full inventory (inventory). You may also examine
the status of a location's current oxygen levels with the command 'inspect oxygen'
